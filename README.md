## Why we need DID

In the universe of Web2.0, we all hold respective accounts among different apps, which represents our unique identity and is attached with all our generated data in the scope.
To many accounts created daily lead to an trouble staff that we have to store or remember all these username&passcode carefully and logon each app with respective unique username&password each time. The root cause of this is that Web2 does not provide a common account(identity) layer, and further, all our accounts generated on application layers cannot easily be shared among most web2 apps. Although it exists some solutions like OAuth2.0 to logon other apps with authorization from Big apps(github, twitter, facebook...) and even further share little data from the latter ones, the accounts issue is not solved at root. On the other hand, in the view of each app, they are also afraid of a mass of zombied accounts and always struggle against these by many solutions.

Furthermore, all data (or asset) generated by users is held by the company behind each app, rather than owned by user themselves, which means user cannot get back their data entirely from these companies and companies can arbitrarily access and totally control all user data including privacy. Besides, the data generated by users in each app is always made usage by these companies to make analysis and make much profit that is not shared with user themselves. Besides, our data stored inside apps(databases actually) encouters hacking&leaking issue easily, many of which you must hear from via news.

Many more cases as above are breaking User Data Sovereignty. On top of these, we desire a pratical solution for series of account issues and get back our rights of data Ownership and Control. And SSI is the popular one and DID is the core and implemention of SSI.

## Current DID

DID(Decentralized IDentity) advocates that everyone has the right to gain access to their own and control over their own digital identity, which can securely store elements of their digital identity and protect privacy. But implementing DID is not easy, which involves the discovery & identification & verification of identities, the trusted storage and computation of related data, the declaration and credentials of identities, and so on.

Based on features from blockchain, People carry out several implementations of DID. Especially with the enrichment of NFT、Gamefi、Metaverse, ID on blockchain also becomes more and more crucial and users need to add more on-chain data to enrich their decentralized identity. In fact, the construction of the Web3 identity itself is significant. First, the on-chain data naturally ensures the transparency and immutableness of user identity and behavior, and establishes the cornerstone of identity trust; Second, Dapp data can be read and called across projects, unlike Web2, which is isolated and stored on a centralized server, thus ensuring the versatility of user identity in the on-chain world.

The core goal of Web3.0 is to empower users by allowing them to control their data, protect their privacy, and ultimately ensure their freedom through an open, censorship-resistant network. With the further enrichment of the crypto circle ecology, Web3 identity will also become an indispensable and important module of the encryption circle.

And now let's go closer to a new implementation of DID: ZKPass.

## What is ZKPass

`ZKPass` is a cryptographic authenticator based on Mina’s Zero Knowledge Proof and acts as a user’s pass to the cryptographic world. Distinguish features are as below:

1. `ZKPass` transforms wallet addresses into friendly, readable and easy-to-remember identifiers similar to the Ethereum ENS, and gives you full control over your encrypted identity without the fear of losing your private key through an unmanaged email social recovery solution.
2. Through Mina Protocol’s the unique ZK Oracle zero-knowledge proof solution, `ZKPass` can bring in real-world attributes such as the user’s real and valid identity tag according to the user’s wishes, while maintaining privacy, allowing users to bind multiple chain addresses and verify their social accounts to make their encrypted identity more valuable. At the same time, through these real and valid off-chain data and users’ on-chain behaviour data to form the users verifiable reputation, the users’ encrypted identity formed based on ZKPass can ensure the uniqueness of the user and be integrated by all Snapps in the ecosystem through SSO services, which can be used to avoid Bots (e.g NFT or airdrop campaign) and achieve more valuable voting governance to maintain fairness users will also get more potential airdrop opportunities and additional incentives from the Dapp.
3. Users can use ZKPass without revealing their external wallet address, which will better protect their privacy through the separation of authorisation and asset control identity keys. We also plan to introduce a contract wallet feature to support a certain level of privacy for transactions.

## Integration

Based on the features above, zkpass is able to be integrated into all snapps as their ID component. You know, ID is really important for some activities of snapps, like avoiding bots in token airdrop or NFT application for a DAO.

## Modular

As you can see, ZKPass is such a big project with several features. Thus we seperate it into multiple modules: Wallet Based on Smart Contract, DID module ([MNS](https://github.com/plus3-labs/mns-frontend) (under development yet)), Shielded Transfer module ([Shadow](https://github.com/plus3-labs/shadow) (under development yet)) and so on.
